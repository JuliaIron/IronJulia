# Activites List

Here are some of the tasks you need to perform:

### Activity 1

- Aggregate data into one Data Frame using Pandas.
- Standardizing header names
- Deleting and rearranging columns – delete the column customer as it is only a unique identifier for each row of data
- Working with data types – Check the data types of all the columns and fix the incorrect ones (for ex. customer lifetime value and number of complaints )
- Filtering data and Correcting typos – Filter the data in state and gender column to standardize the texts in those columns
- Removing duplicates
- Replacing null values – Replace missing values with means of the column (for numerical columns)

### Activity 2

- Bucketing the data - Write a function to replace column "State" to different zones. California as West Region, Oregon as North West, and Washington as East, and Arizona and Nevada as Central
- Standardizing the data – Use string functions to standardize the text data (lower case)

### Activity 3

- Which columns are numerical?
- Which columns are categorical?
- Check and deal with NaN values. (Hint:Replacing null values – Replace missing values with means of the column (for numerical columns)).
- Datetime format - Extract the months from the dataset and store in a separate column. Then filter the data to show only the information for the first quarter , ie. January, February and March. Hint: If data from March does not exist, consider only January and February.
- BONUS: Put all the previously mentioned data transformations into a function/functions.

### Activity 4

- Show a plot of the total number of responses.
- Show a plot of the response rate by the sales channel.
- Show a plot of the response rate by the total claim amount.
- Show a plot of the response rate by income.
- Don't limit your creativity!  plot any interesting findings/insights that describe some interesting facts about your data set and its variables. Use the relevant plotting when you feel it is needed.
- Plot the Correlation Heatmap.
- Clean your notebook and make it a readible and presentable with a good documentation that summarizes the Data Cleaning, Exploration(including plots) Steps that you have performed.
