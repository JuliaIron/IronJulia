# Lab | SQL Queries - Join Two Tables

In this lab, you will be using the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) database of movie rentals. If you need to get the data again, refer to the official [installation link](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html).

2. Which actor has appeared in the most films?
3. Most active customer (the customer that has rented the most number of films)
4. List number of films per `category`.
5. Display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member.
6. Display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005.
7. List each film and the number of actors who are listed for that film.
8. Using the tables `payment` and `customer` and the JOIN command, list the total paid by each customer. List the customers alphabetically by last name.

This query might require using more than one join statement. Give it a try.
